## [3.0.0] (2026-09-21)

The control set now matches the Epiphan Encoders Stream Deck plugin: the same actions, feedbacks, variables,
preset categories, colours and state words, so an operator can move between the two without relearning.
**This is a breaking release for hand-built buttons.** An upgrade script converts every 2.2.0 action and
feedback that has a counterpart; the rest is listed under Removed. Read the upgrade notes before updating a
production connection.

### Added

- Full coverage of the REST API v2.0 (firmware 4.24.1 and newer), with automatic fallback to the legacy API
  on older firmware.
- Actions `singletouch`, `output` (switch an output's source), `preset` (apply a configuration preset),
  `event` (start, stop, pause, resume, extend or toggle a CMS event, by alias or id), `storage` (eject
  removable media) and `audio` (nudge an input's gain or delay by a step; on a Stream Deck+ the dial does the
  same). `recorder` can address all recorders at once and `stream` all publishers of a channel.
- **Confirm with a second press** on Apply Preset, Reboot / Shutdown and Storage eject, on by default: the
  first press arms the button and shows `Press again`, the same button pressed again within 3 seconds sends
  the command.
- Feedbacks `singletouch_active`, `event_state`, `event_applies`, `system` (CPU load, temperature and AFU
  conditions), `storage_level`, `output_set`, `confirm_pending`, `action_failed` (red `Failed` for three
  seconds on a button whose command the device rejected), `preview` and `layout_preview` (live pictures of
  channels, inputs, outputs and layouts on the button) and `audio`, a stereo level meter drawn on the button.
- Variables for publishers (per channel), inputs (name, gain, delay and audio levels), outputs, storages,
  single touch, CMS events (titles, times and countdowns, corrected for the device's own clock), system
  status text, AFU details, configuration presets, `confirm_hint` and `last_error`, plus `_state_word` and
  `_text` variants ready for button text.
- Presets in eleven categories (Recording, Streaming, Layouts, Single touch, Bookmarks, Previews,
  Configuration presets, CMS events, System, Power, Storage), each with the Stream Deck plugin's icon and
  colours. The connection setting **Preset categories to generate** chooses which appear in the preset list.
- Connection settings **Use HTTPS** and **Accept self-signed certificate**, **Request timeout (ms)**,
  **Preview image refresh interval** and **Preview image width**, and **Poll CMS schedule**.
- A removed action that is still on a button is reported once per start in the connection log, with the
  number of buttons that carry it.

### Changed

- Action ids follow the Stream Deck plugin; the upgrade script rewrites existing buttons in place:
  `channelChangeLayout` → `layout` (which gains a typed-id fallback for firmware that does not list layouts),
  `controlStreaming` → `stream`, `recorderRecording` → `recorder`, `insertMarker` → `bookmark`,
  `systemReboot` and `systemShutdown` → `power`. Feedbacks: `channelLayout` → `layout_active`,
  `streamingState` → `stream_state`, `recorderRecording` → `recorder_state`.
- Recording and Streaming toggles stop a recorder or stream that is in an error state instead of sending
  another start.
- Connection settings: **Feedback polling frequency in seconds** is now **Poll interval (ms)**, default 2 s,
  converted from the old value; a failing poll backs off, up to 15 s between tries. **Target IP or hostname**
  and **Target Port** are now **Host** and **Port**.
- Variables renamed: `stream_CID_PID_name`/`_state` → `channel_CID_publisher_PID_name`/`_state`,
  `system_status_cpuload`/`_cputemp`/`_uptime` → `cpu_load`/`cpu_temp`/`uptime_seconds` (with `uptime` as
  text), `identity_name` → `device_name`, `firmware_version` → `firmware`. Companion does not rewrite
  variable references inside button text, so update those by hand.
- The module says "encoder" or "device" rather than "Pearl" in its settings, action descriptions, log and
  help, as the Pearl family will not remain the only Epiphan encoder it drives. New connections are labelled
  `encoder`; the module id is unchanged.

### Removed

- Actions `getLayoutData`, `setLayoutData`, `getContentMetadata` and `setContentMetadata` (no Stream Deck
  counterpart). A button that still holds one keeps its old definition and is named in the connection log.
- Variables `channel_CID_resolution`/`_fps`/`_bitrate`, `channel_CID_metadata_title`/`_author`/
  `_rec_prefix`, `recorder_RID_active`, `stream_CID_PID_bitrate`, `system_status_date`, `identity_location`
  and `identity_description`.
- Preset categories `Channels`, `Publishers` and `Recorders` are now `Layouts`, `Streaming` and `Recording`.

### Upgrade notes

Opening an existing connection runs the upgrade script `convertToParityV300` once: actions and feedbacks are
rewritten to their new ids and options in place, `pollfreq` becomes `poll_interval` in milliseconds, every
preset category is enabled, and the confirm option is left off on buttons that existed before, so they keep
firing on the first press. Removed actions cannot be converted and are left as they were; the connection log
names each one still in use. Button text that uses a renamed or removed variable needs updating by hand.
